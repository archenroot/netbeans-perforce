= File Context Perforce Menu =
The popup, editor context menu also includes a perforce menu to show the perforce operations there as well.   The toolbar is intended as the most convenient access to the normal checkout, add, diff and submit actions.  The popup context menu also contains a "p4 reopen -t +w" option to convert a file type to writable text when checked in.  This can be useful for some IDE config and other similar type files that you don't always want to have to check out and back in, but want to update them into the depot occasionally as references.

Typically, we do this with IDE config trees that we want new developers/client depots to have access to, but which are typically customized per developer.
